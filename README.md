# PythonMath
## Mathematical Functions made in python.

This is a simple script that allows the user to edit a simple list, and run mathematical functions on that list.

- Current capabilities include:
  - Finding the average
  - Finding the mode
  - Finding the median
  - Finding the range
  - Finding the 1st and 3rd quartile. (Finished as of September 7th 2019)
  - Sorting the list (Partially Added)(will cover several functionalities)
  - Adding numbers to the list.


- Planned updates:
  - Deleting numbers from the list.
  - Adding several numbers at once to the list.
  - Finishing the 1st and 3rd quartile section.
  - Adding insert sort functionality.
  - Adding merge sort functionality.
  - Adding simple sort functionality.
  - Adding timers to functions.(And statistical data.)

- Future updates (less immediate):
  - Adding functionality for controlling multiple lists.
  - Adding functionality between lists. (Greatest average value, combine average value, compare ranges, etc...)
