# PythonMath
Mathematical Functions made in python.

This is a simple script that allows the user to edit a simple list, and run mathematical functions on that list.

Current capabilities include:
      - Finding the average
      - Finding the mode
      - Finding the median
      - Finding the range
      - Finding the 1st and 3rd quartile. (Unfinished)
      - Sorting the list (Not Added)(will cover several functionalities)
      - Adding numbers to the list.


Planned updates:
      - Deleting numbers from the list.
      - Adding several numbers at once to the list.
      - Finishing the 1st and 3rd quartile section.
      - Adding insert sort functionality.
      - Adding merge sort functionality.
      - Adding simple sort functionality.
      - Adding timers to functions.(And statistical data.)

Future updates (less immediate):
      - Adding functionality for controlling multiple lists.
      - Adding functionality between lists. (Greatest average value, combine average value, compare ranges, etc...)
