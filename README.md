# PythonMath
## Mathematical Functions made in python.

This is a simple script that allows the user to edit a simple list, and run mathematical functions on that list.

- Current capabilities include:
  - Finding the average
  - Finding the mode
  - Finding the median
  - Finding the range
  - Finding the 1st and 3rd quartile. (Finished as of September 7th 2019)
  - Sorting the list (Partially Added)(will cover several functionalities)
  - Adding numbers to the list.
  - Deleting numbers from the list. (Finished as of January 4th 2020)
  - Adding several numbers at once to the list. (Finished as of January 4th 2020)


- Planned updates:
  - Adding merge sort functionality.
  - Adding shuffle functionality.
  - Adding timers to sorting functions.

- Future updates (less immediate):
  - Adding a command line type of interaction rather then the current menu-driven interaction
  - Adding functionality for controlling multiple lists (as data sets).
    - Combining data sets and their statistics.
    - Splitting a data set into separate lists.
    - Compare statistics between data sets.
  - Adding functionality between data sets. (Greatest average value, combine average value, compare ranges, etc...)
  - Store data sets on disk.
  - Retrieve data set from disk.
